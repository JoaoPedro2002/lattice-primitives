# lattice-voting-ctrsa21

Code accompannying the paper "Lattice-Based Proof of Shuffle and Applications to Electronic Voting" by Diego F. Aranha, Carsten Baum, Kristian Gj√∏steen,
Tjerand Silde, and Thor Tunge accepted at CT-RSA 2021.

Depedencies are the GMP and FLINT 2.7.1 libraries.

For building the code, run `make` inside the source directory. This sill build the binaries for `commit`, `vericrypt` and `shuffle` to test and benchmark different modules of the code.
